\item{export_path}{Optional. Path to export CSV file. If NULL, returns dataframe without exporting.}

\item{include_context}{If TRUE (default), includes example contexts for each suggestion.}

\item{context_examples}{Number of example contexts to include per suggestion. Defaults to 3.}

\description{
This function is a work in progress and should not be used yet.
}
\details{
Analyzes parsed output from parse_text() to identify tokens and phrases that
may be entities but were not tagged by spaCy's NER. Exports suggestions to a
CSV file for user review. After review, the CSV can be used with entity_specify()
to create EntityRuler patterns.
